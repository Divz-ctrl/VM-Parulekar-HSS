  PRASHANT NAIK
Principal

V.M. Parulekar Higher Secondary School has come a long way from its
humble beinnings. Having taken the reins of our higher secondary school in
2016, my aim is to keep the flag of the institution flying high as ever. It is
responsibility I hold vase to my heart and one which I intend to fulfill in the
best possible manners.

Here at V. M. P. planning and balance is the key to our healthy and
respectable existence. Here we plan each day meticulously to give space to all
that is important such as work & play thought & action, mirth & emphathy.
give & take, contentment & gratitude. We treat each day like a miniature
piece of life, extract the maximum from it and give back our best.

Nevertheless, we shall keep surging ahead with the same passion, zeal
and intent to fulfill our respected chairman's grand vision that +2 education
should be within the reach of every single child of his village and its
surrounding areas as well.

Our two great hallmarks in imparting education shall always remain
CHARACTER and DEPTH in whatsoever we so or undertake and we
promise we shall always stand the test of time".
